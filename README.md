Conveyor Belt Provocation Scripts

This work was done by Tanaya Puranik in the Borton Neuromotion Laboratory under the guidance of Dr. David Borton. The goal of the project was OCD biomarker detection for a long-term exposure task. These scripts are a part of the statistical analysis pipeline developed along and do not include the functional connectivity and classifier work. For additional information and questions please contact tanayapuranik@gmail.com.

Task Information:
During this task designed by Nicole Provenza in the Borton Lab, a distress-inducing object sits on a conveyor belt that comes closer and farther away from the participant with OCD. The participant rates their distress level at multiple points of the task. 

Script Information: Additional READme in each folder have more detailed information. Below is an overview.

1. Conveyor Belt Rotary Encoder
Information for the conveyor belt position, the distress ratings by the participants, and the timings were captured by two rotary encoders.

2. Conveyor Belt Behavior Analysis
Visual analysis to understand patient response to task.

3. EEG Preprocessing
Processing EEG signal from task and visualization of EEG signal.

4. EEG Analysis
Extracting data, statistical analysis to detect changes in EEG signal, and visualization of results.

5. Permutation Test
Computed adjusted p-value with Bonferroni correction and False Discovery Rate with a permutation test.
